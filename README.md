:D Hia! :3 I'm Khayla, a winter fox. I love my softpink #FBBED3 with a bit of white, and other pastel colors too! I like to take pictures of nature, especially of pretty flowers. I take care of house and gardens, and I work at a cafe. I love 3d modelling and 3d printing, and coding, and tech repair and assembly, and videogames. I prefer cats, but some dogs are nice and relaxed.
